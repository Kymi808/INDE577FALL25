# Ensemble Methods

This directory contains example code and notes for the Ensemble Methods algorithm
in supervised learning.

## Algorithm

This example uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset: 30 numeric features (e.g., texture, smoothness); label is binary (malignant vs. benign). Data loaded via sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer. Tree ensembles do not require scaling; we include median imputation to handle potential missing values in other datasets.
