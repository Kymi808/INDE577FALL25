# Jupiter Notebook Examples
This directory contains examples of common unsupervised learning algorithms,
including clustering methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, and
community detection algorithms and common supervised learning algorithms
for both regression and classification, such as linear and logistic regression,
decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, ensemble methods, and neural networks.

# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning refers to machine learning tasks where each example comes
with an associated label or target value. The goal is to learn a mapping from
inputs (features) to outputs (labels) so that the model can make accurate
predictions on new, unseen data.


# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning refers to machine learning tasks where data does not come
with explicit labels or target values. The goal is to uncover structure in the
data, such as clusters, lower-dimensional representations, or communities.
